          <h3>The Old Man's Cassette</h3>
          <p>
            There’s this eerie story about an old man and his cassette. His name
            was Jimmy (Jim) Wells. He was born on October 15, 1895, in Chicago,
            Illinois. Jim lived a pretty normal life, just an average guy
            working in the music shop he opened himself in 1933, during the
            Great Depression. Jim had always been a thinker with a good sense of
            the future, which is why he took the risk and opened his own
            business. He had a feeling that by the end of the 30s, the music
            industry was going to boom.

                music shop.

            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            He lived a good life, had a family, and kids. But his wife got
            seriously ill and passed away in the 70s. By then, he had lost
            contact with his children, so all that was left to him was his music
            shop.

          </p>
          <p>
            Then, in 1977, a truly creepy tragedy struck. During a robbery at
            his shop, Jim Wells was shot and killed by an unknown assailant
            right there on the spot. What makes it even weirder is that the
            crime took place while Jim was trying to record something with a
            cassette recorder. Since that day, people say the cassette, which
            supposedly contains the recording of his murder, is somehow
            connected to Jim’s restless spirit. Whoever finds and plays the
            cassette will be haunted by him and ultimately, killed.

            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            There have been many violent deaths linked to the cassette. People
            who played it never lived to tell the tale. The cassette has been
            destroyed multiple times, but for some reason, it always comes back.
            People tried locking it away, even labeling it with a warning:
            "Don’t play me." The strangest part is, the cassette keeps
            reappearing in different places, over and over again. To this day,
            no one really knows if the story is true, or if it’s just some
            twisted legend. But one thing’s for sure: if you ever come across
            that cassette, maybe it’s better not to hit play.
