          <h3>The Tale of Finn Kreutzer</h3>
          <p>
            So here’s a creepy story I heard a while back. It’s about a kid
            named Finn Kreutzer, who lived in Switzerland in the '90s. He was a
            14-year-old boy from a farming family, and he was kind of an
            outsider. He didn’t fit in much, but somehow he ended up hanging out
            with a group of kids from his class. One day, they were just messing
            around like usual, goofing off in a cornfield, playing
            hide-and-seek. But that day was different.
            <figure>
              <img src="img/finn/4.jpg" />
              <figcaption>
                Cornfields from that region of Switzerland
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the middle of the field, they found this huge hole, like the
            earth had just caved in. And right in the center of the hole was a
            scarecrow. It looked… wrong. The group ran over to it, and that’s
            when the leader of the group, who was always a bit of a jerk, came
            up with a “brilliant” idea. He decided that Finn should prove
            himself if he wanted to stay part of the group. He dared Finn to
            spend the night by the scarecrow, alone, as some kind of initiation.
            Finn didn’t want to do it. He didn’t think friends should ask stuff
            like that. But the others weren’t having it. They grabbed him, tied
            him to the scarecrow like some twisted prank, and ran off laughing.
            “See you tomorrow. Have fun tonight,” they yelled as they
            disappeared into the night.
            <figure>
              <img src="img/finn/3.jpg" />
              <figcaption>
                People say it was also a full moon that night
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hours passed, and Finn was stuck there in the cold and dark. The
            night felt like it would never end. Meanwhile, the others started
            feeling bad about what they’d done. They decided they’d go back,
            untie him, and make sure he was okay. But when they went back to the
            spot where they’d left him, he was gone. There was no sign of Finn
            anywhere. They called his name, but there was nothing. Just the
            whispering of the corn in the wind. Days turned into weeks. Finn was
            reported missing, and the group of boys who had left him there never
            spoke about it again. They pretended like it never happened. Then,
            about a week later, they found a body in the cornfield. It was
            completely decomposed, and the eyes had been ripped out, probably by
            the crows. It was so bad that the police had to cover the body with
            a burlap sack, so Finn’s parents wouldn’t have to see their son like
            that. But everyone knew it was him.
            <figure>
              <img src="img/finn/2.jpg" />
              <figcaption>
                The crime scene, according to the police reports
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, people started talking. And that’s when the legend of
            Finn Kreutzer began. They say there’s still a scarecrow in that same
            cornfield, but it’s not just any scarecrow. It’s said to hold the
            spirit of Finn, twisted and vengeful. And ever since that night,
            there have been more reports of people going missing around the
            area. It’s like something’s out there, waiting. The scarecrow still
            stands, with a burlap sack over its head and empty, hollow eyes. And
            if you disturb it, well, let’s just say you won’t make it out alive.
            They say Finn’s spirit is still roaming the field, and it’s out for
            revenge.
            <figure>
              <img src="img/finn/1.jpg" />
              <figcaption>
                Someone said they saw the scarecrow once... they might be the
                only one who made it out alive, if it's true
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you ever find yourself near a cornfield in Switzerland,
            especially near those old farm areas, you might want to stay far
            away from any scarecrow. You never know if it’s really just a
            scarecrow or if it’s Finn watching you, waiting.
