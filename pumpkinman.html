          <h3>Edward Jones (1843–1885)</h3>

          <p>
            Edward Jones was a farmer in Pennsylvania during a period of
            widespread poverty and food shortages in rural villages. He became
            well-known for cultivating extensive pumpkin plantations, which he
            regularly sold at local weekly markets. He was considered by many to
            be insane and unstable. He was never a man of many words, and he
            usually only appeared in public during the month of October. He
            lived away from the town on his farm in a remote cabin.

          </p>

          <h3>Early Life and Farming</h3>
          <p>
            Edward Jones was born in 1843 in Pennsylvania. Little is known about
            his early life, but he became a farmer and earned a reputation for
            his large pumpkin fields. These pumpkins provided a significant
            portion of his income, which he generated through sales at the local
            markets.

          </p>
          <h3>Acts of Charity</h3>
          <p>
            In one particularly harsh year, the village where Edward Jones lived
            suffered a poor harvest, and the threat of winter exacerbated the
            already dire situation. In response, Jones began secretly placing
            pumpkins on the doorsteps of the poorer residents in the village.
            Although the identity of the benefactor was not officially known,
            many suspected Jones was behind the generous acts.

            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            As he saw the need growing, Jones expanded his charitable efforts,
            distributing pumpkins on the streets to anyone in need, including
            women, men, children, and the elderly.
          </p>
          <h3>Controversy and Disappearance</h3>
          <p>
            Tragedy struck the village during the following winter when a
            farmer's child died from food poisoning. The grieving father, driven
            by suspicion and anger, accused Edward Jones of being responsible.
            In his rage, the farmer incited the local community against Jones.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Halloween night, a mob of villagers, armed with pitchforks,
            torches, and other tools, stormed Jones's pumpkin fields and sought
            him out. They eventually found him in his remote cabin. After that
            night, Edward Jones was never seen again, and his fate remains a
            mystery. The villagers maintained a collective silence about the
            incident, and Jones's once-thriving pumpkin fields were left barren.
          </p>
          <h3>Legacy and Folklore</h3>
          <p>
            In the years following his disappearance, reports began to surface
            of strange pumpkins appearing on doorsteps throughout the village.
            Whether these were the work of a copycat or if Edward Jones had
            somehow returned has never been determined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, those involved in the mob that sought out Jones on
            Halloween night reportedly died one by one in the years that
            followed, fueling local myths and superstitions about the
            mysterious events surrounding Edward Jones. Since that incident,
            there have been frequent reports of brutal deaths and murders.
          </p>

            Possible witnesses have described seeing a tall man. He is said to
            have a face like a pumpkin and a large sickle in his right hand.

          <p>
            Many refer to Edward Jones as the Pumpkin Man. Even today, there are
            police reports of people claiming to be haunted by the Pumpkin
            Curse. The Pumpkin Curse is a curse where pumpkins mysteriously
            appear in front of doorsteps throughout October. Many of those
            affected were brutally murdered on the night of October 31st. The
            perpetrator was never found. Others reported that they accepted all
            the pumpkins and nothing happened to them.

            Maybe Edward Jones was just misunderstood. His story sounds like it
            was twisted over the years, but there’s no denying the weird deaths.
            Spooky stuff!
